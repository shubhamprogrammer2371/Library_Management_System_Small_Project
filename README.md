# Library_Management_System_Small_Project

I have created a small Library Management System which has the following Functionalities :-
1) Add Books (Upto 3 Books per Category).
2) Display All Book Information (Category Wise).
3) Search Books (Books Status).

I have used basic C programming like Loops,Structures,Flow Control Statements to create this small project.
